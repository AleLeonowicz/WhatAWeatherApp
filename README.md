An application presenting weather forecast and historic data for a selected place on earth. 6-day weather overview (starting with the weather info from three days ago until the weather forecast for the day after tomorrow) gives a good feeling of the current conditions. In addition, the user gets a short description and an illustration of the clothes combination which is the best choice for the moment of search. All the graphic assets make the app intuitive, easy, and quick to use.

The application is powered by the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
All SVG icons and illustrations were created by the [author](https://github.com/AleLeonowicz) of the application.
